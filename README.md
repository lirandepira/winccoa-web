DESCRIPTION:
A RESTful API was developed to access the data directly from the ORACLE database and provide it to the user as a JSON object, which can then be easily used in user scripts.

SETUP:
- virtualenv running Python 3.4.8 and Django 2.0.2. A guide on the compatibility of Python versions with Django versions can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/faq/install/#what-python-version-can-i-use-with-django

- Installation has been done following the guide here: https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-django-on-centos-7
Note: replate the 'pip' command with 'pip3.4' for the installation of pip v3 to be used with python3.

- Developed on CentOS 7
